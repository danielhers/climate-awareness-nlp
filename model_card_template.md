### Climate performance model card
The following provides climate performance information about the model,
according to the guidelines proposed by
[Hershcovich et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05071):
| Minimum card | |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 1. Is the resulting model publicly available? | |
| 2. How much time does the training of the final model take? | |
| 3. How much time did all experiments take (incl. hyperparameter search)? | |
| 4. What was the energy consumption (GPU/CPU)? | |
| 5. At which geo location were the computations performed? | |
| Extended card | |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 6. What was the energy mix at the geo location? | |
| 7. How much CO2eq was emitted to train the final model? | |
| 8. How much CO2eq was emitted for all experiments? | |
| 9. What is the average CO2eq emission for the inference of one sample? | |
| 10. Which positive environmental impact can be expected from this work? | |
