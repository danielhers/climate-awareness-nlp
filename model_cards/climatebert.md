|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 1. Is the resulting model publicly available?                            | Yes            |
| 2. How much time does the training of the final model take?              | 48 hours        |
| 3. How much time did all experiments take (incl. hyperparameter search)? | 350 hours      |
| 4. What was the power of GPU and CPU?                                    | 0.7 kW         |
| 5. At which geo location were the computations performed?                | Germany        |
| 6. What was the energy mix at the geo location?                          | 470 gCO2eq/kWh |
| 7. How much CO2eq was emitted to train the final model?                  | 15.79 kg        |
| 8. How much CO2eq was emitted for all experiments?                       | 115.15 kg       |
| 9. What is the average CO2eq emission for the inference of one sample?   | 0.62 mg        |
| 10. Which positive environmental impact can be expected from this work?  | This work can be categorized as a building block tools following Jin et al (2021). It supports the training of NLP models in the field of climate change and, thereby, have a positive environmental impact in the future. |
